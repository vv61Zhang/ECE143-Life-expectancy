Apply regression to build a prediction model for life expectancy.

For neural network, PyTorch package is required. Preferably with a GPU.

Test with least square method and shallow neural network, linear regression on the way.
We want to rebuild this model after apply PCA to original data and select more important features.

With the model, we can show how change of one feature changes the life expectancy more clrealy.
We reached a mean sqaure error around 5 with shallow neural network, trying to build more accurate models.
